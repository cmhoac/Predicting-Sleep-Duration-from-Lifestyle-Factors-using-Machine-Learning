# Predicting-Sleep-Duration-from-Lifestyle-Factors-using-Machine-Learning
Developed a predictive model using the Gradient Boosting Regressor to estimate sleep duration based on lifestyle and health factors. Achieved high accuracy with an R² score of 0.992 on the test set.
# Member: 4
# Roles:
+	Collected and preprocessed data samples from the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset (Kaggle).
+	Performed EDA by summarizing data, visualizing distributions, and analyzing correlations to identify key factors affecting sleep duration.
+	Developed and trained machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree Regression) using a structured ML pipeline.
+	Evaluated models with cross-validation, achieving MSE = 0.00534 and R² = 0.99222 on the test set with Gradient Boosting Regressor (best model).
+	Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
+	Identified key predictors such as sleep quality, stress levels, and heart rate, providing actionable insights into sleep patterns.
